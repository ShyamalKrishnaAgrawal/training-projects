                            The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. 
                            They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure. 
                            These five principles help us understand the need for certain design patterns and 
                            software architecture in general. So I believe that it is a topic that every developer 
                            should learn. This article will teach you everything you need to know to apply 
                            SOLID principles to your projects.

                            The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and 
                            therefore it should have only a single reason to change. To state this principle 
                            more technically: Only one potential change (database logic, logging logic, and so on.) 
                            in the software’s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class. 
                            This means that if a class is a data container, like a Book class or a Student class, and 
                            it has some fields regarding that entity, it should change only when we change the data 
                            model. Following the Single Responsibility Principle is important. First of all, because 
                            many different teams can work on the same project and edit the same class for different 
                            reasons, this could lead to incompatible modules. Second, it makes version control easier. 
                            For example, say we have a persistence class that handles database operations, and 
                            we see a change in that file in the GitHub commits. By following the SRP, we will 
                            know that it is related to storage or database-related stuff. Merge conflicts are 
                            another example. They appear when different teams change the same file. But if the 
                            SRP is followed, fewer conflicts will appear – files will have a single reason to change, 
                            and conflicts that do exist will be easier to resolve.
